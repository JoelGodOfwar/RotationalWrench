Right Click a block, if it doesn't rotate, try Shift Right Clicking it.

Some blocks will rotate one way on Right Click, and another way on Shift Right Click. If Right clicking and Shift Right Clicking don't work, try Left Clicking and Shift Left Clicking, if none of those work then it doesn't rotate..
